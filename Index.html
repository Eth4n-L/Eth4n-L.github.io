<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In the ocean many creatures roam the sea and this website is dedicated to one of them, jellyfish.<br> Jellyfish are aquatic animals belonging to the cnidarians family. Jellyfish have no bones because <br>they are invertebrates. Jellyfish live in all oceans, from the surface sunlight level all the way down <br> to the abyssal zone. Jellyfish primarly stick to open waters but can also be found in coral reefs as well</p>

<h2 div class= "Appearance"> Appearance </h2>

<p div class= "Appearance"> Jellyfish have a variety of different appearances and colours but most of them have certain things<br> in common with each other.

<ul div id= "jellyfish-parts">
<li>The Bell</li>
<li>Eye Spots</li>
<li>Mouth</li>
<li>Tentacles</li>
<li>Oral Arms</li>
</ul>

<p div class= "Appearance-info">The Bell<br> <br>The bell is the part of the jellyfish you see on the top, with its dome-like shape. The bell is used to propel them forward. Inside the bell you can find many things like the mouth and the muscle band that is used for propulsion <br> <br> Eye Spots<br> <br> Also known as the rhopalia, the eye spots are located near the edge of the bell. The eye spots contain sensors that help detect light intensity, helping jellyfish navigate the open waters.<br> <br> Mouth<br> <br> The mouth of a jellyfish is located at the bottom centre of the bell. The mouth is used to digest food and can also discard the waste from a jellyfish.<br> <br> Tentacles<br> <br> The tentacles are located around the edge of the bell. Tentacles help jellyfish capture prey with their paralyzing stingers. The tentacles contain stingers and depending on the jellyfish, the stingers can contain venom that has varying effects.<br> <br> Oral Arms<br> <br> The oral arms are located right at the bottom middle of the bell, close to the mouth. The oral arms are used to bring prey to the jellyfish's mouth. Some jellyfish can use their oral arms to eat, not having a mouth.</p>

<h2 div class= "life cycle">Life Cycle</h2>

<p div class= "life cycle">The life cycle of jellyfish can vary depending on the species. Some small jellyfish can only live for <br> a few hours while larger ones can live for a few years. There's species of jellyfish that can actually <br> live indefinitely and they are known as immortal jellyfish. Immortal jellyfish are able to revert <br> their bodies back to an adolescent state using transdifferentiation, this process works when the cells <br>of the jellyfish revert back from mature cells to pre stem cells, this allows them to theoretically live forever.</p>

<h2 div class= "jellyfish-types">Types of Jellyfish</h2>

<p div class= "jellyfish-types">There's many different jellyfish that roam the seas. Their sizes and venom levels can vary greatlly, some being<br> as big s cars and ohers only the size of a pebble.</p>
